This project is an interactive Snake game implemented using Python, OpenCV, and Pygame. The game uses computer vision techniques to track the movement of the playerâ€™s hand, allowing them to control the snake by moving their hand in front of a webcam. The goal is to eat the apples that randomly appear on the screen while avoiding the boundaries.

Features:
Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and track the player's hand movements.
Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows in length as it consumes apples.
Boundary Detection: The game ends if the snake touches the boundaries.
Sound Effects: Includes sound effects for eating apples, winning the game, and game over events using Pygame.
Score Display: Real-time display of the player's score.
Random Apple Placement: Apples appear at random positions within the game boundaries.
How to Play:
Run the Game: Launch the game by running the main Python script.
Control the Snake: Use your hand to control the snake's movement in front of the webcam.
Eat Apples: Guide the snake to the apples to increase your score.
Avoid Boundaries: Ensure the snake does not touch the boundaries to keep playing.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Pygame
Numpy
Imutils
